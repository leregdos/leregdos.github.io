## Documentation of Process

### 1. Conceptualization

- We explored various thematic elements, including Arabic Folklore and Greek Mythology. We wanted to make sure that our concept included elements of both. For instance, the monster that guides the crystal was inspired by Ourobouros, the serpent from Greek mythos.
- Following in-depth discussions and creative deliberations, we finalized an original storyline featuring our heroine, Maya's valiant battle to protect her village from the malevolent forces of a mystical crystal.

### 2. Design

- We mapped out the comic's layout and interactive features through storyboards and wireframes.
- We aimed for a captivating reader experience by embedding some interactive elements within the comic panels.

### 3. Comic Creation and Animation

- We first illustrated comic strips, complete with imagery and text bubbles.
- Then, we used animation techniques to give life into our panels, thereby enhancing reader engagement and immersion.
- We also discovered royalty-free audio effects from Pixaby to add depth and realism to the storytelling experience.

### 4. Website Integration and Interactivity

- We hosted our comic on our Github Pages website [](https://leregdos.github.io/interactive-webcomic/), featuring a range of engaging elements including sounds and interactable panels.
- We also added a sound button to certain panels where a sound effect can enrich the story. To make sure we do not startle our readers, we made sure to give the agency of playing the sound to the reader.
- We added another layer of interactivity on the comic website. Used p5.js and Adobe Photoshop for making two of the panels interactive.
- Finally, we created the comic title using Photoshop and Illustrator for a distinct look.

### 5. Challenges and Solutions

- We have encountered some challenges in generating consistent character images, which were overcome by leveraging Prompt engineering techniques to refine and enhance our visuals.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Interactive Animations

- We aspired to animate every panel and the text boxes to maximize interactivity. However, as we learned, it was quite hard to achieve that even with using various tools at our disposal such as Adobe After Effects. In the future, we would like to augment interactivity by integrating more dynamic animations.
- We also wish to gather valuable feedback from our audience to identify opportunities for improvement and enrichment of the overall reading experience.
