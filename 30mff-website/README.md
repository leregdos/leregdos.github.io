### Project Name

Our project's name is "Finding Campus Cats". It was inspired by Pixar studios' famous animation "Finding Nemo".

### Project Description

This project includes both a short film and an accompanying website. On the website, visitors have the opportunity to view the entire film, which was ambitiously shot within a 30-minute timeframe. Additionally, the website offers interactive features designed to enhance engagement with the campus cats. These include an image slideshow that showcases the cats in various campus settings, as well as a unique, cat-shaped cursor that adds an element of surprise by transforming when hovered over specific elements. The overall concept is the promotion of healthy cohabitation with the cats on NYUAD campus.

I was striving to create a website that satisfied the following criteria that we covered during class for best user experience: simplicity, navigation, visual hierarchy, grid based layout, and load time while simultaenously telling a coherent story so that the user cares about the content.

### Process

1. The first step in the creative process was the shooting of the film. As we had only 30 minutes to shoot and edit a short film, we had to be fast. The film we had shot revolved around the campus cats, inspired by the daily interactions between the students and the cats.

2. Secondly, I created a wireframe to decide which types of content the website should include. For someone who had never created a wireframe before, it was a learning experience, as I had gotten a feedback from our professor citing the necessity of the website being a part of something: a concept behind it.

3. Therefore, the next step was to identify the concept behind the whole project. Observing the cats' antics, the comfort they brought, and the unofficial roles they assumed as stress relievers during exam seasons, sparked a realization of their integral presence within our campus community. The concept of protecting the campus cats naturally emerged from this introspection, driven by a desire to advocate for those who have become such an endearing part of our campus life. This website then came to be designed for the members of the NYUAD community to promote the campus cats.

4. The next step for me was to build a short prototype based on the website wireframe. I did not rush to start writing code, therefore I decided to do some UI / UX prototyping on Figma. For me, this was the most challenging part of the project. As I had no design experience prior to starting the project, I started to be challenged by even the selection of the font.

5. The coding part was surprisingly unfamiliar. I realized that despite having experience with web based technology, I had completely forgotten the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project was a great opportunity to remind myself of those fundamental technologies. After getting good grips with the concepts of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I started to plan out what exactly I'm planning to do with each of them. The website's HTML needed to follow the wireframe, the CSS needed to follow the prototype, and the Javascript needed to follow both depending on which functionality I wanted. After figuring out these, it was smooth sailing.

6. In the process of building the website, I kept in mind the web design principles that we covered in class. The final product I came up with aligned with several of these criteria:

- The website is simple in color and typography. I purposefully decided to keep the colour selection limited to less than 3 colours. I chose the main colour to be the NYU purple, due to the fact that the concept is also about NYUAD. Furthermore, through a process of trial and error I went with the Roboto font as it felt the easiest on the eye.

- The website is very simple to navigate through. It is a single scroll-down webpage on which everything is divided into sections.

- The website also has a very clear visual hierarchy. Every section has a title that is of bigger size than the normal text, and important parts of the text were sometimes highlighted in bold.

- The website also has a grid based layout. Every section is arranged into a clean rigid grid structure with rows and columns, and together they feel balanced and impose order.

- Last but not least, the website has a very short loading time. To satisfy this, I purposefully avoided uploading large assets to the website so that we don't overwhelm the end user's device. The largest asset I had was the film itself, and I didn't want to compress the video to make the film lose quality. Fortunately, YouTube allows us to upload videos in high quality and embed them in our websites. That is exactly what I did.

### Reflection/Evaluation

The concept I decided on during the creative process was the promotion of the campus cats so that we always remember to treat them carefully. In my eyes, the final product complemented this concept with the interactiveness of digital media. It showcased the NYUAD community through its color scheme, and it showed that these cats are an integral part of our community. It also included some tips on how NOT to interact with these cats. My goal of building an interactive website that added upon the film's story is met in the final product.
